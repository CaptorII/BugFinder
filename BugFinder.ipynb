    "### Scenario\n",
    "Develop a model to be used with a hand-held hyperspectral camera system to identify harmful pests on containers and vessels entering the country, with the aim of preventing those pests from establishing themselves in this country and destroying native wildlife. This project will use a standard camera to develop a proof of concept for this system."
