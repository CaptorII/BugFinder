    "Develop a model to be used with a hand-held hyperspectral camera system to identify harmful pests on containers and vessels entering the country, with the aim of preventing those pests from establishing themselves in this country and destroying native wildlife. This project will use a standard camera to develop a proof of concept for this system."

If the data were cleaned to remove caterpillars, or if those were labelled separately, the model would most likely be much more accurate. In addition, this model is limited in identifying the 5 types of insects it has been trained on, and may mistake similar insects for these. This would be solved by including a greater variety of insects to the dataset, and using a larger dataset overall."
